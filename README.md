## My AWS Challenge

I'm taking on the AWS Beginners Challenge! Over 4 projects, I will be learning the practical side of learning AWS. I'm learning AWS because when I was an SDE intern at AWS, I realized that I do not know anything about AWS, what it is about and what is going on. I hope through this course. i will finally be able to know about what AWS is about and why most comapnies use it's resources.

### Hold Me Accountable!

I'm challenging myself to complete all 4 projects in the next 4 days. To make it happen, I will keep myself accountable by ensuring that I create and learn about the AWS through those projects. My reward for completing this challenge will be an Ice cream treat.

## What is Cloud?

Before cloud computing, we had to rely on our physical hardware - we needed to have software, photos, data, apps all living and running inside our physical computer.

Now with cloud computing, we can access files, application and data from anywherre in the world as long as we have an internet connection.
We can use unlimited storage, powerful virtual computers(servers), and even advanced tools like AI and data analytics without needing our own hardware..

### What is AWS?

AWS is the leading cloud platform that provides computing resources, like storage, databases, and networking, over the internet. Its data centers power about a third of the cloud computing services running every day! 

AWS professionals help build and maintain things in the Amazon's cloud so businesses do not need to worry about physical servers. Some popular cloud career paths include Cloud Architects, Devops, Security and Data Engineers. Today, I'm most interested in DevOps, actually all. Will see which one interests me more as time goes on.
